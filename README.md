## Diabetes Prediction

- Data Acquisition: The diabetes dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes/data).
- Advanced Modeling Techniques: I emloyed various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN in showcasing versatility in modeling approaches and the ability to select the best model based on performance metrics.
- Hyperparameter Optimization: Used RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest model, resulting in improved model performance and demonstrating a deep understanding of model optimization techniques.
- Robust Model Evaluation: I Conducted thorough model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, showcasing a strong grasp of model validation techniques and the ability to effectively interpret and communicate results.
